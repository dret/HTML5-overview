      <td> This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML. MathML is
         a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure
         and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and
         processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.
         This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily for a readership
         consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using
         it, or software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output.
         It is not a User's Guide but rather a reference document. MathML can be used to encode
         both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML
         tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and
         seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression.
         Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact,
         and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally,
         this document addresses the issue of special characters used for mathematics, their
         handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their relation to fonts. While
         MathML is human-readable, authors typically will use equation editors, conversion
         programs, and other specialized software tools to generate MathML. Several versions
         of such MathML tools exist, both freely available software and commercial products,
         and more are under development.
