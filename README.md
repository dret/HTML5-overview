# HTML5 Overview

HTML5 is more a movement (or maybe it's more appropriate to call it a *brand*) than it is a technology. It says "more power to the browser" but mostly means "more power to the browser *as a programming platform*". Given this focus of HTML5, it is surprisingly hard to find a good place where all the APIs under development are listed. This collection is an attempt to have all that information in one place. The current status captured on this page lists 138 specifications. Since the HTML5 landscape is changing fairly quickly, it is likely that some information on this page is outdated. If that is the case, please submit an issue or create a pull request (please keep in mind that the [MD](README.md) is generated from [XML](html5.xml) via [XSLT](XSLT/xml2md.xsl)). Thanks!

Most HTML5 specifications are [W3C](http://www.w3.org/ "World Wide Web Consortium") [TR track documents](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#rec-advance "W3C Technical Reports"), and of those this page lists 95 current specifications, while [a separate page lists 32 specifications that were retired as notes](MD/notes.md) (127 total).

HTML5 specifications are also developed in other places, and this page lists 11 of these other specifications.

Here's a list of all HTML5 specs captured in the [XML source for this page](html5.xml), first W3C TR (except for the [separately listed NOTEs](MD/notes.md)), and then others:

## W3C TR Specifications (127 Specs)

The user agent is in a better position to determine the ideal animation rate based on whether the page is currently in a foreground or background tab, what the current load on the CPU is, and so on. Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate utilization of the CPU by the browser.")
* [Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI "This specification describes a JavaScript API for performing basic cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing, signature generation and verification, and encryption and decryption.

* [Encoding](http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding "While encodings have been defined to some extent, implementations have not always implemented them in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge.")
* [Encrypted Media Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media "This proposal extends HTMLMediaElement providing APIs to control playback of protected content. The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies. This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the simple clear key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline. The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license or other server.")

([ED](https://w3c.github.io/geofencing-api/ "Editor's Draft"))
* [HTML 5.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/html51 "This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.")
* [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0 "HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM) defines how user agents map HTML 5.1 elements and attributes to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). It leverages and extends the Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 and the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1 for use with the HTML 5.1 host language. Documenting these mappings promotes interoperable exposure of roles, states, properties, and events implemented by accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.")
* [HTML Imports](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports "HTML Imports are a way to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.")
* [High Resolution Time Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-2 "This specification defines an API that provides the current time in sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.")
* [Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtcstats "This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that allow access to the statistical information about a PeerConnection.")
* [IndieUI: Events 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events "IndieUI: Events 1.0 is an abstraction between physical, device-specific user interaction events and inferred user intent such as scrolling or changing values. This provides an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events, and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications. IndieUI: Events focuses on granular user interface interactions such as scrolling the view, canceling an action, changing the value of a user input widget, selecting a range, placing focus on an object, etc. Implementing platforms will combine modality-specific user input, user idiosyncratic heuristics to determine the specific corresponding Indie UI event, and send that to the web application in addition to the modality-specific input such as mouse or keyboard events, should applications wish to process it.")
* [IndieUI: User Context 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-context "IndieUI: User Context defines a set of preferences that users can choose to expose to web applications, and an API for user agents to access the preferences and listen for changes. User can set preferences for features such as screen and font size, color, and typographical preferences. Users with disabilities can provide information about assistive technologies in use, indicate that the display is in an accessibility mode, and indicate whether and what kind of subtitles and audio descriptions they need. Web applications can use this information to optimize the presentation without a requirement to target a specific device, operating system, or locale. While customizations based on these properties benefit users, the information could also be used to make assumptions about users or compromise anonymity. Therefore, the specification includes user agent requirements to allow users to opt out and choose not to expose information on a category basis to preserve privacy.")
* [Input Method Editor API](http://www.w3.org/TR/ime-api "This specification defines an ”IME API” that provides Web applications with scripted access to an IME (input-method editor) associated with a hosting user agent. This IME API includes: an InputMethodContext interface, which provides methods to retrieve detailed data from an in-progress IME composition; and a Composition dictionary, which represents read-only attributes about the current composition, such as the actual text and its style. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with DOM events.")
* [Manifest for Web Application](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest "This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to ”scope” a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to ”deep link” into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with a manifest.")
* [Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-depth "This specification extends the Media Capture and Streams specification to allow a depth stream to be requested from the web platform using APIs familiar to web authors.")

* [Network Error Logging](http://www.w3.org/TR/network-error-logging "This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.")
* [Network Service Discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/discovery-api "This specification defines a mechanism for an HTML document to discover and subsequently communicate with HTTP-based services advertised via common discovery protocols within the current network.")
* [Performance Timeline Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline-2 "This specification extends the High Resolution Time specification by providing methods to store and retrieve high resolution performance metric data.")
* [Preload](http://www.w3.org/TR/preload "This specification defines the preload relationship of the HTML Link Element (<link>).")
* [Presentation API](http://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api "This specification defines an API to enable web content to access external presentation-type displays and use them for presenting web content.")
* [Privileged Contexts](http://www.w3.org/TR/powerful-features "This specification provides guidelines for user agent implementors and spec authors for implementing features whose properties dictate that they be exposed to the web only within a trustworthy environment.")
* [Push API](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api "The Push API provides webapps with scripted access to server-sent messages, for simplicity referred to here as push messages, as delivered by push services. A push service allows an application server to send messages to a webapp, regardless of whether the webapp is currently active on the user agent. The push message will be delivered to a Service Worker, which could then store the message's data or display a notification to the user. This specification is designed to promote compatibility with any delivery method for push messages from push services to user agents.")
* [Quota Management API](http://www.w3.org/TR/quota-api "This specification defines an API to manage usage and availability of local storage resources, and defines a means by which a user agent (UA) may grant Web applications permission to use more local space, temporarily or persistently, via various different storage APIs.")
* [Referrer Policy](http://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy "This document describes how an author can set a referrer policy for documents they create, and the impact of such a policy on the referer HTTP header for outgoing requests and navigations.")
* [Resource Hints](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints "This specification defines the dns-prefetch, preconnect, prefetch, and prerender relationships of the HTML Link Element (<link>). These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance.")
* [Resource Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing "This specification defines an interface for web applications to access timing information related to HTML elements.")
* [Runtime and Security Model for Web Applications](http://www.w3.org/TR/runtime "This document specifies a runtime and security model for Web Applications. It describes how an application is defined through an application manifest, and how it can be installed, updated and packaged. It also specifies how such an application can be put into the background, be put back in the foreground or woken up. Finally, the document describes the security model for such applications. This includes the permission model and the different security rules that would apply.")

* [Server Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing "This specification introduces Server Timing, which enables the server to communicate performance metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent, and a JavaScript interface to enable applications to collect, process, and act on these metrics to optimize application delivery.")
* [Service Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers "This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline. The core of this system is an event-driven Web Worker, which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided. The Service Worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that is extensible by other specifications.")
* [Shadow DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom "This specification describes a method of establishing and maintaining functional boundaries between DOM trees and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the DOM.")
* [Streams API](http://www.w3.org/TR/streams-api "WHATWG Streams API spec provides an API for representing and handling a stream of data in JavaScript. This W3C spec is intended to extend the WHATWG spec to meet requirements specific to the browser environment.")
* [Subresource Integrity](http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI "This specification defines a mechanism by which user agents may verify that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation.")
* [The Permissions API](http://www.w3.org/TR/permissions "The Permissions API allows a web application to be aware of the status of a given permission, to know whether it is granted, denied or if the user will be asked whether the permission should be granted.")

* [Wake Lock API](http://www.w3.org/TR/wake-lock "This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request a wake lock. A wake lock prevents some aspect of the device from entering a power-saving state (e.g., preventing the system from turning off the screen).")
* [Web Animations](http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations "This specification defines a model for synchronization and timing of changes to the presentation of a Web page. This specification also defines an application programming interface for interacting with this model and it is expected that further specifications will define declarative means for exposing these features.")
* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio "This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly/C/C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (using the responseType and response attributes). For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the canvas 2D and WebGL 3D graphics APIs.")
* [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi " Some user agents have connected music devices, such as synthesizers, keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines. The widely adopted Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes, controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch data). This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses, such as show control, lighting and special effects control. This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems. At the same time, the Web MIDI API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically. To some users, ”MIDI” has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI. That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML5 <audio> element, for example). The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example, or even the software synthesizers that are built in to many common operating systems. The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications. The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API and High-Resolution Time. This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.")
* [WebCrypto Key Discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/webcrypto-key-discovery "This specification describes a JavaScript API for discovering named, origin-specific pre-provisioned cryptographic keys for use with the Web Cryptography API. Pre-provisioned keys are keys which have been made available to the UA by means other than the generation, derivation, import functions of the Web Cryptography API. Origin-specific keys are keys that are available only to a specified origin. Named keys are identified by a name assumed to be known to the origin in question and provisioned with the key itself.")
* [WebDriver](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver "This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a browser. The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser. This specification also includes a non-normative reference useful for browser vendors.")
* [WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc "This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be sent over the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time protocols, and media to be received from another browser or device. This specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.")
* [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1 "This specification defines WebVTT, the Web Video Text Tracks format. Its main use is for marking up external text track resources in connection with the HTML <track> element. WebVTT files provide captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions, chapters for content navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.")
* [XMLHttpRequest](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest "The XMLHttpRequest specification defines an API that provides scripted client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.")

## Other Specifications (11 Specs)

* [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/ "The Fetch standard defines requests, responses, and the process that binds them; fetching.")
* [FileSystem API](http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/ "The FileSystem API defines functionality on a local sandboxed file system within the same origin of the Web Application that created it. It exposes standard file system operations to Web Applications, such as creation of files and directories, and reading and writing of them (from and to disk), including other programmatic manipulation of files and directories.")
* [Fullscreen API](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/ "Fullscreen defines the fullscreen API for the web platform.")
* [Generic Sensor API](http://w3c.github.io/sensors/ "This specification defines a framework for exposing sensor data to the Open Web Platform in a consistent way. It does so by defining a blueprint for writing specifications of concrete sensors along with an abstract Sensor interface that can be extended to accommodate different sensor types.")
* [Notifications API](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/ "This standard defines an API to display notifications to the end user, typically outside the top-level browsing context's viewport. It is designed to be compatible with existing notification systems, while remaining platform-independent.")
* [Storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/ "The Storage Standard defines an API for persistent storage and quota estimates, as well as the platform storage architecture.")
* [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/ "This document describes an API to discover and communicate with devices over the Bluetooth 4 wireless standard using the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).")
* [Web NFC API](http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/ "Near Field Communication (NFC) enables wireless communication between two devices at close proximity, usually less than a few centimeters. NFC is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) defining an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices operating at 13.56 MHz. This specification defines an API to manage selected NFC use-cases from web pages, and to enable new use-cases based on NFC technology.")
* [Web Speech API Specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html "This specification defines a JavaScript API to enable web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control. The JavaScript API allows web pages to control activation and timing and to handle results and alternatives.")
* [WebGL 1.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/ "This specification describes an additional rendering context and support objects for the HTML 5 canvas element. This context allows rendering using an API that conforms closely to the OpenGL ES 2.0 API.")
* [WebGL 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/ "This is Version 2.0 of the WebGL Specification. This specification describes an additional rendering context and support objects for the HTML 5 canvas element. This context allows rendering using an API that conforms closely to the OpenGL ES 3.0 API. This document should be read as an extension to the WebGL 1.0 specification. It will only describe the differences from 1.0.")
